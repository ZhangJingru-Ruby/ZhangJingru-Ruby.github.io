## üöÄ Research & Projects

#### <span class="ruby-title">Intelligent Detection and Management of Foreign Objects in Complex Airport Scenarios</span>  
#### <em class="ruby-sub">(*National Key R&D Project, 2024 ‚Äì Present*)</em>

**Responsibility**\
Independently researching autonomous conflict avoidance methods for multi-objective operational scenarios on airport aprons.\
**My work**\
Developed and implemented an innovative Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (RL) optimization algorithm to improve autonomous navigation in highly dynamic environments.\
**Collaborations**\
Collaborated cross-functionally within the research team, ensuring system-level integration by working with ROS and SLAM-based modules. Also contributed to adjacent projects, including a vision-language question-answering system based on large-scale remote sensing data.\
**Outcomes**\
One first-author paper under submission to ICRA 2025 and one invention patent in process. Codebase and methodological highlights are available on my GitHub.

#### <span class="ruby-title">Challenge Cup: Real-Time Intelligent Perception and Inference System for UAV Payload Imagery</span>  
*Jun 2025 ‚Äì Aug 2025*

**What we did**\
Developed a real-time intelligent perceptioin and inference system for UAV based on vision that can identify scene and objects and recognize intention.\
**My work**\
Developed and deployed a deep learning-based trajectory prediction and intent recognition system for drone payload imagery, optimized for execution on domestic AI hardware platforms.\
**Outcomes**\
Currently participating in the ongoing competition phase as part of a national-level Challenge Cup initiative.

#### <span class="ruby-title">Tello Drone Vision-Based Object Tracking</span>  
<em class="ruby-sub">*Undergraduate Thesis, Oct 2023 ‚Äì Jun 2024*</em>

**My work**\
Designed and implemented a real-time object identification and tracking system using DJI Tello drones.

#### <span class="ruby-title">National Intelligent Robotics Innovation Competition</span>  
#### *(May 2022 ‚Äì Aug 2022)*

**What we did**\
Developed an intelligent refrigerator capable of automatic identification, food analysis, and hygiene reminders.\
**My work**\
Led software architecture, mechanical design, and final presentation.\
**Outcomes**\
Awarded 1st Prize (Sichuan Province), 2nd Prize (National).

#### <span class="ruby-title">Precision Positioning for Embedded Smart Car 
#### *(Modern Electronics Project, Sep 2022 ‚Äì Nov 2022)*

**My work**\
Designed and implemented control algorithms for a smart car capable of fast and accurate positionin using an STC89C52 RC microcontroller and developed in the Keil uVision5 environment.\
**Outcomes**\
Successfully demonstrated real-time localization on a physical car platform, contributing to coursework excellence and hands-on embedded systems training.
