Our team has just completed the **Preliminary Round** of the **National Challenge Cup Competition** with a key milestone — building our **prototype** for a *real-time intelligent perception and inference system for UAV-based vision*.
The system is capable of **scene & object recognition** and **intention inference** from drone payload imagery.

### **My Role** 👩‍💻

I was responsible for **developing and deploying a deep learning–based trajectory prediction and intention recognition system**.

### **My Work During This Stage** 🛠️

1️⃣ **Technical Research** – Conducted in-depth literature review on *anomaly detection* and *intention inference*, gaining a strong grasp of current state-of-the-art methods.
2️⃣ **System Design** – Designed the technical route for the intention inference module based on research findings.
3️⃣ **Dataset Exploration & Processing** – Searched extensively for suitable open-source datasets, shortlisted candidates, and prepared the final dataset for model training.
4️⃣ **Model Development** –

- Assisted in building and training the **trajectory prediction model** (mentoring teammates unfamiliar with deep learning).
- Independently developed a **rule-based intention inference model** that classifies the target’s intention using predicted trajectories.
  
5️⃣ **Documentation & Reporting** – Authored technical documentation and contributed to our project report.
6️⃣ **Collaboration** – Participated in frequent team meetings and alignments, ensuring technical consistency across a team of 5+ members — my first time working in a large technical project team.

### **Key Technical Gains** 📚⚙️

- Proficiency in Python libraries such as **NumPy**, **Colorama**, and **Shapely** for data processing and visualization.
- Hands-on experience with **deep learning deployment** workflows.
- Domain-specific knowledge in **trajectory prediction**, **intention inference**, and **rule-based reasoning**.

---

### **Personal & Professional Takeaways** 🌱💡

- **The power of visual thinking** – Creating diagrams and slides not only improved communication with teammates but also clarified my own technical understanding. This was essential in refining our dataset requirements and aligning our project direction.
- **Stay goal-oriented** – In complex, multi-person projects, it’s critical to regularly check if the team is still heading toward the same objective, preventing wasted effort and ensuring cohesive progress.
- **Technical writing is as important as coding** – Clear, structured documentation reflects technical understanding and strengthens the project as a whole. This experience reinforced my commitment to making writing a core part of my development process.

---

This competition has been both a **technical challenge** and a **personal growth journey**. As we move forward, I’m excited to refine our system further, enhance its robustness, and explore advanced approaches for UAV-based perception and inference. ✨
