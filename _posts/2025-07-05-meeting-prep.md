I‚Äôm mentoring and collaborating with a junior lab member as we tackled a complex autonomous navigation research project. As the work grows more technical, keeping our collaboration clear and goal-aligned becomes increasingly important.

To help guide our weekly sync, I drafted a structured meeting prep note with key reflection points and expectations. I‚Äôve found that thoughtful communication like this not only boosts efficiency, but also supports my teammate‚Äôs growth‚Äîand mine. üå±

Below is the full note I shared‚Äîdesigned to spark clarity, accountability, and smoother handoffs.

## Reflections on Last Week's Handover
Your last update was actually very detailed-lots of tasks completed!üëè But one small issue: the report lacked a clear **logical structure** and **inter-task relationships**, Most points focused on what you did, but didn't explain why you did them, how they connectto larger goals, or what comes next.

For example, your previous report include:
- Installed rosnav and cadrl from GitHub and deployed them in Arena; dragon failed to deploy
- Ran multi-scenario, multi-task, multi-algorithm testing. Found that all 3 task modes and 9 scenarios worked, but there were issues with certain algorithms
- Installed the arena-evaluation tool but got stuck during data recording
- Rule-based algorithm insertion failed; A* vehicle didn't move

These are all valuable observations, but as a reader l found myself wondering:
- Where exactly are you in the project timeline?
- Which tasks are on the critical path
- Which issues are blockers, and which are secondary?
- What's your next step for resolving them?
This might be because you didn't have a clear "mental map" while working-or perhaps i didn't give you one upfront. So tomorrow'smeeting is all about drawing that map together!üó∫Ô∏è

## Meeting Objectives
Our goal is to figure out:
- Where we currently stand in the overall projectWhether we've drifted from our goals
- What we need to prioritize next
- A clear To-Do list with deadlines
- How we'll collaborate moving forward

---
## Meeting Flow
I'll begin by:
- Explaining my current framework
- Share my recent progress and planning
- Clarify what lexpect from our current collaboration phase

Together we'll:
- assess how far we are from our goals
- Finalize:
  - ‚úÖClear TODOs
  - ‚è∞Deadlines(DDLs)
  - üîÅHandover & colaboration mechanism

## It'd be great if you could think ahead about the following:
- What did we discuss in our last video meeting? 
- What tasks did l assign to you back then?
- How are those tasks going now? Any blockers?
- Please bring your laptop and walk me through:
  - Your overall project structure
  - The code structure
  - The relationships and communication between module.

**Ask yourself:**
- What kind of information am  trying to convey when l introduce this?
- What would be the most logical order?
- How can l explain it clearly and intuitively?

You don't need to prepare anything perfectly-we're organizing our thoughts, not giving a formal presentation. Take it easy Just thinking it through in advance wil make tomorrow's conversation much smoother.
