This week was tough but triumphant. With heavy workloads from multiple fronts and disrupted sleep, it was both physically and mentally challenging 😮‍💨. But I actively sought solutions—exploring healthier sleep rhythms and new ways to decompress—and in the end, I still made meaningful progress 💪. This week reminded me of the importance of balance amid pressure, and taught me to stay resilient while listening to my needs.

## 🚀 WORK

### 🧠 Research Progress

✅Implemented a new network structure that filled previous blind spots in my approach. Shifted the focus from distance-based metrics to exploration potential, replacing the original ot2goal module with a numerical exploration indicator.

✅Trained across multiple settings, experimenting with different reward functions and parameters. However, entropy adjustments interfered with stable convergence and led to local optima traps.

✅Ultimately simplified the strategy—abandoned neural networks and pivoted to a rule-based policy, which performed exceptionally well! 🎉

### 🌐 GitHub Page Development

✅Structured the site into distinct sections and finalized the overall layout!

✅Published two new posts:
Last Week's Work Log

❌Result: had to restart everything from scratch 😭
