It’s been quite a while since my last update. After two intense months filled with courses, finals, competition work, and a short summer break, I’m ready to get back on track. These past two months have been both eventful and rewarding, bringing growth in both my personal and professional journey. 🌱

## 💼WORK

### 🏆Challenge Cup Competition 

My team and I have entered the National Challenge Cup Competition with the topic:
📎Real-Time Intelligent Perception and Inference System for UAV Payload Imagery

My responsibilities include:
- Dataset selection and processing for model training
- Developing the Intention Inferencer model 

We’ve now entered the Preliminary Round and successfully built our prototype. 
This project has been a huge learning experience — not only in coding and system building, but also in team collaboration and project management. I’ll share another post soon to document the technical and personal takeaways from this journey.

### 🧠My Research ⚙

My RL-based autonomous navigation research progressed more slowly this period due to the competition, IELTS preparation, and finals.

Still, I made some key advances:
Rewrote my paper draft after my mentor’s feedback that the first version lacked clarity.
The second draft shows major improvement — and I’ve realized that writing is not just about presenting results, but a critical part of research itself.
Through writing, I’ve been able to identify gaps in my work and refine the logic, which is crucial for moving the research forward.
